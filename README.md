# parallel-dp

In this repo, we will explore two dynamic programming problems: Segmented Least Squares and Weighted Least Interval Scheduling.

We will describe a sequential dynamic programming solution, and then parallelize that algorithm and the change in time complexity.

To test the code, navigate to the problem directory: either
```
cd segmented-least-squares
/* OR */
cd weighted-least-interval-scheduling
```

And then run the following:
```
./s.sh
```
